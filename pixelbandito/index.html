                <p>
                    I hate having to go to more than one place for things. I'd like to try using structured comments in conjunction with a barebones github repo to replace a roadmap / ticketing system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'd start an empty repo, add a README, and leave comments that describe desired functionality, priority, responsible individuals, dependencies, etc. Then you'd run a utility that scans the repo and compiles your todo list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Github issues already does a pretty good job with feature requests, but issues are still a proprietary Github-ism, right? This would be 100% portable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S. For javascript, I think the decorators pattern could work instead of comments, but one of the challenges is finding a syntax that you could use to create issues and requests in any file in the repo. I think a structured comment is a better fit, since every programming language I've used has some kind of block comment feature.

                    The gradient in the background is a work-in-progress.

                <p>
                    It uses a linear gradient (with creative license) to represent a day-night cycle. The gradient is positioned vertically according to the browser's local time, and it animates up and down on a 24 hour cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daycycle currently lives in a subfolder of <a class="pxb-t-link" href="https://github.com/pixelbandito/theeraio.github.io">pixelbandito/theeraio.github.io</a>, so feel free to leave comments / issues on that repo. I'll break it out into its own when I have a little time.
